# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
The deployment is failing with "An unexpected error happened when running this build" during the deployment phase, even though the build completes successfully.

## Solutions to Try

### 1. Retry Deployment
The error appears to be transient. Try redeploying:
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
- Or push a new commit to trigger a fresh deployment

### 2. Check Vercel Status
- Visit https://status.vercel.com/
- Check if there are any ongoing issues with Vercel services

### 3. Optimize Build Configuration
The current configuration has been optimized:
- ✅ Fixed `@gradio/client` version to `^0.15.0`
- ✅ Simplified `vercel.json` configuration
- ✅ Added proper build scripts

### 4. Alternative Deployment Methods

#### Option A: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from project directory
vercel --prod
```

#### Option B: GitHub Integration
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Enable automatic deployments
3. Push changes to trigger deployment

### 5. Build Optimization
If the issue persists, try:
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Build locally to test
npm run build

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### 6. Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel:
- No additional environment variables needed for this project

## Current Status
- ✅ Build process works locally
- ✅ All dependencies are correct
- ✅ Vercel configuration is optimized
- ⚠️ Deployment phase has transient error

## Next Steps
1. Try redeploying from Vercel dashboard
2. If issue persists, contact Vercel Support
3. Consider using Vercel CLI for deployment
